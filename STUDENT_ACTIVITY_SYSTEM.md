# StudentActivity System Implementation

## Overview
Created a comprehensive student activity tracking system that centralizes all student progress across different activity types within modules.

## Models Created

### 1. StudentActivity (Main Model)
**Purpose**: Central hub for tracking all student activities within modules
**Key Features**:
- Tracks activity status (not_started, in_progress, completed, submitted, graded)
- Records scores and progress data
- Links to specific activity types through polymorphic relationships
- Automatic progress calculation based on activity type

**Database Schema**:
```sql
- user_id (foreign key to users)
- module_id (foreign key to modules)
- course_id (foreign key to courses)
- activity_id (foreign key to activities)
- activity_type (enum: quiz, assignment, project, assessment)
- status (enum: not_started, in_progress, completed, submitted, graded)
- score, max_score, percentage_score
- timestamps for started_at, completed_at, submitted_at, graded_at
- progress_data (JSON for type-specific data)
- feedback (text)
```

### 2. StudentAssignmentProgress
**Purpose**: Track assignment submissions and grading
**Key Features**:
- Submission content and file attachments
- Revision tracking and submission status
- Due date management and overdue detection
- Instructor comments and rubric-based grading

### 3. StudentProjectProgress
**Purpose**: Track project-based learning with phases and deliverables
**Key Features**:
- Multi-phase project tracking
- Team collaboration support (individual, pair, group)
- Deliverable management and completion tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Progress percentage calculation

### 4. StudentAssessmentProgress  
**Purpose**: Track competency-based assessments and skill evaluations
**Key Features**:
- Multiple assessment types (formative, summative, diagnostic, benchmark)
- Skill-based scoring and competency mapping
- Self, peer, and instructor assessments
- Mastery level tracking (not_met, approaching, met, exceeded)
- Evidence artifact storage

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/student/module/status/{module_id}
**Purpose**: Get comprehensive module status for authenticated student
**Returns**:
```json
{
  "module_id": 1,
  "module_title": "Introduction to Programming",
  "module_type": "mixed",
  "is_completed": false,
  "can_mark_complete": false,
  "overall_progress_percentage": 65.5,
  "activity_status": {
    "total": 4,
    "completed": 2,
    "in_progress": 1,
    "not_started": 1,
    "completion_percentage": 50
  },
  "lesson_status": {
    "total": 3,
    "completed": 3,
    "completion_percentage": 100
  },
  "next_actions": [
    {
      "type": "complete_activity",
      "title": "Complete: Final Quiz",
      "activity_id": 15,
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST /api/student/module/complete/{module_id}
**Purpose**: Mark module as complete for authenticated student
**Validation**: 
- Checks enrollment in course
- Validates all required activities and lessons are completed
- Prevents duplicate completions

**Returns**:
```json
{
  "message": "Module marked as complete successfully",
  "completion_id": 123,
  "completed_at": "2025-10-07T21:23:45.000000Z",
  "course_progress": 75.5
}
```

## Business Logic

### Module Completion Rules
1. **Mixed Modules**: Both all activities AND all lessons must be completed
2. **Activity-Only Modules**: All activities must be completed
3. **Lesson-Only Modules**: All lessons must be completed
4. **Default**: Both activities and lessons must be completed

### Progress Calculation
- Weighted by total items (activities + lessons)
- Real-time updates when individual items are completed
- Supports different completion criteria per module type

## Model Relationships

### User Model
- `hasMany(StudentActivity::class)`
- `hasMany(ModuleCompletion::class)`
- `hasMany(StudentQuizProgress::class)`

### Module Model  
- `hasMany(StudentActivity::class)`
- `getStudentActivities(userId)` helper method

### Activity Model
- `hasMany(StudentActivity::class)`
- `getStudentActivity(userId, moduleId)` helper method

### StudentActivity Relationships
- `belongsTo(User::class, Module::class, Course::class, Activity::class)`
- `hasOne(StudentAssignmentProgress::class)`
- `hasOne(StudentProjectProgress::class)`
- `hasOne(StudentAssessmentProgress::class)`
- `belongsTo(StudentQuizProgress::class)` - uses existing quiz system

## Key Features

### 1. Centralized Tracking
- Single source of truth for all student activity progress
- Consistent status management across activity types
- Unified progress reporting

### 2. Flexible Activity Types
- Supports existing quiz system
- New assignment, project, and assessment tracking
- Extensible for future activity types

### 3. Comprehensive Progress Data
- Multiple progress indicators (percentage, status, scores)
- Time tracking for all major events
- Custom progress data storage per activity type

### 4. Module Completion Intelligence
- Automatic completion validation
- Smart next-action suggestions
- Module-type-aware completion rules

### 5. API Integration
- RESTful endpoints for frontend consumption
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Detailed progress information for UI

## Usage Examples

### Creating Student Activity
```php
$studentActivity = StudentActivity::create([
    'user_id' => $userId,
    'module_id' => $moduleId,
    'course_id' => $courseId,
    'activity_id' => $activityId,
    'activity_type' => 'assignment',
    'status' => 'not_started',
]);

// Create assignment progress
$assignmentProgress = $studentActivity->assignmentProgress()->create([
    'due_date' => Carbon::parse('2025-10-15'),
    'points_possible' => 100,
]);
```

### Checking Module Status
```php
// Via API endpoint
GET /api/student/module/status/1

// Via model methods
$user = auth()->user();
$activities = $user->getModuleActivities($moduleId);
$progress = $activities->sum('percentage_score') / $activities->count();
```

### Marking Module Complete
```php
// Via API endpoint
POST /api/student/module/complete/1

// Via model
if ($module->canBeCompleted($userId)) {
    ModuleCompletion::create([
        'user_id' => $userId,
        'module_id' => $moduleId,
        'course_id' => $courseId,
        'completed_at' => now(),
    ]);
}
```

## Security Features
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Course enrollment verification
- User-specific data isolation
- Proper authorization checks

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time progress updates via WebSockets
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Gamification elements (badges, achievements)
- Integration with external learning tools
- Bulk progress import/export functionality
