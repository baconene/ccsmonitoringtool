# Quiz Add Question Modal Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Modal Not Storing Succeeding Data
**Problem:** When adding multiple questions, the modal was not clearing the form data after submission, causing the previous question's data to persist.

**Root Cause:** The form data was not being reset after successful submission, causing the modal to retain previous values when reopened.

**Solution:**
- Added form reset in the `handleSubmit` function after emitting the submit event
- Created a deep copy of formData when submitting using spread operator `{ ...formData.value }`
- Enhanced the `watch` on `question_type` to properly reset options and correct_answer when switching types

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
const handleSubmit = () => {
    // ... validation checks ...
    
    emit('submit', { ...formData.value }); // Deep copy to prevent reference issues
    // Reset form after successful submission
    resetForm();
};

watch(() => formData.value.question_type, (newType) => {
    // Reset options and correct answer when changing type
    formData.value.options = [];
    formData.value.correct_answer = '';
    
    // ... rest of the logic
});
```

### 2. Enumeration Questions Missing Correct Answer Field
**Problem:** Enumeration type questions had no way to specify the correct answer(s).

**Root Cause:** The `showCorrectAnswer` computed property only checked for `true-false` type, excluding enumeration.

**Solution:**
- Updated `showCorrectAnswer` computed property to include enumeration type
- Added a textarea input for enumeration answers (allows multiple lines)
- Added validation to ensure enumeration questions have a correct answer before submission
- Added helpful text indicating users can enter multiple answers (one per line)

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
const showCorrectAnswer = computed(() => 
    formData.value.question_type === 'true-false' || 
    formData.value.question_type === 'enumeration'
);

// Validation in handleSubmit
if (formData.value.question_type === 'enumeration' && !formData.value.correct_answer) {
    alert('Please provide the correct answer for enumeration');
    return;
}
```

**Template Changes:**
```vue
<div v-if="showCorrectAnswer">
    <label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-1">
        Correct Answer <span class="text-red-500">*</span>
    </label>
    <select v-if="formData.question_type === 'true-false'" ...>
        <option value="true">True</option>
        <option value="false">False</option>
    </select>
    <textarea
        v-else-if="formData.question_type === 'enumeration'"
        v-model="formData.correct_answer"
        rows="3"
        placeholder="Enter the correct answer(s) for enumeration (one per line)"
        required
    />
    <p v-if="formData.question_type === 'enumeration'" class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1">
        For multiple answers, enter each on a new line
    </p>
</div>
```
