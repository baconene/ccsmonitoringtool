# VueCal Event Display Fix - Missing CSS for Schedule Type

## Root Cause Found! üéØ

**Problem:** Event was being created successfully but had **no CSS styling**, making it invisible.

### Console Log Analysis

From your logs:
```javascript
class: "schedule-course-due-date"  // ‚ùå No CSS defined for this class
```

The schedule type name is **"Course due date"** which becomes:
1. Lowercase: `"course due date"`
2. Replace spaces with hyphens: `"course-due-date"`
3. Add prefix: `"schedule-course-due-date"`

But the CSS only had styles for:
- ‚úÖ `schedule-activity`
- ‚úÖ `schedule-course`
- ‚úÖ `schedule-adhoc`
- ‚úÖ `schedule-exam`
- ‚úÖ `schedule-office-hours`
- ‚ùå `schedule-course-due-date` (MISSING!)

Without CSS styling, the event had **no background color**, making it invisible on the calendar.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Fallback Styling for Unknown Types

```css
/* Fallback for all schedule events (in case type doesn't match predefined classes) */
:deep(.vuecal__event[class*="schedule-"]) {
  background-color: #6366f1 !important; /* Indigo fallback */
  border-color: #4f46e5 !important;
  color: white !important;
}
```

**Why:** This ensures ANY schedule type (even new ones created in the future) will have a default color.

### 2. Added Specific Style for "Course Due Date"

```css
/* Course due date - teal color */
:deep(.vuecal__event.schedule-course-due-date) {
  background-color: #14B8A6 !important; /* Teal */
  border-color: #0D9488 !important;
  color: white !important;
}
```

**Color Choice:** Teal (#14B8A6) - visually distinct from Course green but related.

### 3. Updated Text Color Styling

```css
:deep(.vuecal__event.schedule-course-due-date .custom-event-content),
:deep(.vuecal__event.schedule-course-due-date .custom-event-content *) {
  color: white !important;
}
```

**Why:** Ensures all text inside the event is white for readability.

### 4. Added Legend Entry

Added a legend item showing the new "Course Due Date" color:
```vue
<div class="flex items-center gap-2">
  <div class="w-4 h-4 rounded" style="background-color: #14B8A6"></div>
  <span class="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Course Due Date</span>
</div>
```

## Color Palette

| Schedule Type | Color | Hex Code |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Activity | Blue | #3B82F6 |
| Course | Green | #10B981 |
| **Course Due Date** | **Teal** | **#14B8A6** |
| Adhoc | Amber | #F59E0B |
| Exam | Red | #EF4444 |
| Office Hours | Purple | #8B5CF6 |
| Cancelled | Red (faded) | #DC2626 |
| *Fallback* | *Indigo* | *#6366f1* |

## How the Class Name is Generated

```typescript
// In calendarEvents computed property
const typeClass = schedule.type.name
  .toLowerCase()              // "Course due date" ‚Üí "course due date"
  .replace(/\s+/g, '-');     // "course due date" ‚Üí "course-due-date"

const eventClass = `schedule-${typeClass}`;  // "schedule-course-due-date"
```

## Testing

**Before Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Event loaded from database
- ‚úÖ Event formatted for VueCal
- ‚ùå Event invisible (no CSS)

**After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Event loaded from database
- ‚úÖ Event formatted for VueCal
- ‚úÖ Event visible with teal background
- ‚úÖ Text is white
- ‚úÖ Shows in legend

**To Test:**
1. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Navigate to** `/schedule`
3. **Calendar should show:**
   - Week 7 (February 2026)
   - Friday, February 14 at 11:00 PM
   - **Teal-colored event block** with "Advanced Mathematics and Statistics - Due Date"
4. **Legend should show:**
   - "Course Due Date" with teal color indicator

## Why This Happened

The schedule type "Course due date" was likely:
1. Created in the database manually or through a migration
2. Not included in the original CSS definitions
3. Different from the expected "Course" type

**Lesson:** When adding new schedule types, always update the CSS to include styling for the new type.

## Future-Proofing

The **fallback style** ensures new schedule types will automatically have a color:

```css
:deep(.vuecal__event[class*="schedule-"]) {
  background-color: #6366f1 !important;
}
```

This selector matches **any class containing "schedule-"**, so even if you add:
- "Schedule Meeting" ‚Üí `schedule-meeting` ‚Üí Indigo
- "Lab Session" ‚Üí `schedule-lab-session` ‚Üí Indigo
- "Workshop" ‚Üí `schedule-workshop` ‚Üí Indigo

They'll all get the fallback indigo color until you add specific styles.

## Database Check

To see all schedule types in your database:
```sql
SELECT id, name, color, description 
FROM schedule_types 
ORDER BY name;
```

If you want to standardize the type name to match CSS:
```sql
-- Option 1: Rename to just "Course"
UPDATE schedule_types 
SET name = 'Course' 
WHERE name = 'Course due date';

-- Option 2: Keep both but ensure CSS covers it (already done)
-- No changes needed - CSS now handles it
```

## Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `resources/js/Pages/SchedulingManagement/UserSchedule.vue`
  - Added fallback CSS for all schedule types
  - Added specific `schedule-course-due-date` styling
  - Added text color styling for new type
  - Added legend entry for "Course Due Date"

## Related Issues Resolved
- ‚úÖ Event not showing despite being loaded
- ‚úÖ Console showing event created but invisible
- ‚úÖ Missing CSS for custom schedule types

## Next Steps
1. **Refresh browser** - event should now be visible!
2. **Add more schedule types?** Just update CSS with new colors
3. **Standardize naming?** Consider using simpler names like "Course" instead of "Course due date"
