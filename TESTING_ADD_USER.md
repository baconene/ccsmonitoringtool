# Testing Add User Functionality

## What to Check

### 1. Open the Role Management Page
- Navigate to the Role Management page
- Click the "Add User" button

### 2. Verify the Modal Form Has All Fields
You should see:
- ✅ **Name** field (text input)
- ✅ **Email** field (email input)
- ✅ **Password** field (password input) - **THIS SHOULD NOW BE VISIBLE**
- ✅ **Role** dropdown (Student, Instructor, Admin)

### 3. Test Password Field
The password field now has:
- Minimum length validation (8 characters)
- A helpful placeholder text
- A hint below the field: "Password must be at least 8 characters long"

### 4. Fill Out the Form
Try creating a user with:
```
Name: Test User
Email: test@example.com
Password: password123
Role: Student
```

### 5. Check Browser Console
Open the browser console (F12) and look for these logs:
1. When you submit: `Submitting new user data: {name, email, password, role}`
2. In the composable: `Creating user with data: {name, email, password, role}`
3. On success: `User created successfully: {user data}`

### 6. Expected Behavior

#### If Successful:
- ✅ Modal closes automatically
- ✅ Green success notification appears: "User created successfully"
- ✅ User appears in the table
- ✅ Console shows successful creation

#### If Error (e.g., email already exists):
- ❌ Modal stays open
- ❌ Red error notification with specific message
- ❌ Console shows the error details

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Password field not visible
**Cause**: Browser cached old version
**Solution**: 
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if `npm run build` completed successfully

### Issue 2: Validation error "password is required"
**Cause**: Password not meeting Laravel's requirements
**Solution**: 
- Use at least 8 characters
- Laravel's default password rules apply

### Issue 3: 422 Unprocessable Entity
**Possible causes**:
- Email already exists
- Password too short
- Invalid role name
- Missing required fields

**Check**: Browser console for detailed validation errors
