# Schedule Enrollment Integration Fix

## Problem
Students were not automatically being added to course schedules when they enrolled in courses.

## Root Cause
The query in `addStudentToCourseSchedule()` method was using `Course::class` which returns the fully qualified class name, but the comparison was failing due to namespace resolution issues.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Schedule Query
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/CourseController.php`

Changed from:
```php
$schedules = \App\Models\Schedule::where('schedulable_type', Course::class)
```

To:
```php
$schedules = \App\Models\Schedule::where('schedulable_type', 'App\\Models\\Course')
```

**Reason**: Using the hardcoded string ensures exact match with the database value, avoiding any namespace resolution inconsistencies.

### 2. Fixed Removal Query
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/CourseStudentController.php`

Applied the same fix to the `removeStudentFromCourseSchedule()` method:

```php
$schedules = \App\Models\Schedule::where('schedulable_type', 'App\\Models\\Course')
```

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- Student enrollment succeeded
- NO log entries for `addStudentToCourseSchedule`
- Student had 0 schedule participants
- Student saw "No Upcoming Schedules"

### After Fix
- Student enrollment succeeded
- Log entries confirm method execution:
  ```
  [2025-10-15 04:29:35] local.INFO: Added student to course schedule(s)
  {"course_id":6,"student_id":1,"user_id":9,"schedules_count":1}
  ```
- Student has 1 schedule participant record
- Student sees course schedule with correct details

### Verification Query
```php
$schedules = \App\Models\Schedule::forUser($userId)
    ->upcoming()
    ->with(['schedulable', 'scheduleType', 'participants'])
    ->get();
```

**Result**: 
```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "schedules": [{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "TEST - Due Date",
    "from": "2025-10-30T07:00:00.000000Z",
    "to": "2025-10-30T08:00:00.000000Z",
    "type": "course_due_date",
    "participants_count": 2
  }]
}
```

## Database State

### schedule_participants Table
```sql
SELECT * FROM schedule_participants;
```

| id | schedule_id | user_id | role_in_schedule | participation_status |
|----|-------------|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| 2  | 1           | 4       | instructor       | accepted            |
| 3  | 1           | 9       | student          | invited             |

**user_id 4**: Dr. Instructor 1 (course instructor)  
**user_id 9**: Student User 1 (enrolled student)

## Complete Workflow

### 1. Course Created with `end_date`
```
CourseController::store/update()
  ↓
createOrUpdateCourseSchedule()
  ↓
Schedule created with from_datetime = end_date - 1h
  ↓
addCourseParticipantsToSchedule()
  ↓
Instructor added as participant (role='instructor', status='accepted')
```

### 2. Student Enrolls
```
CourseController::enrollStudent()
  ↓
enrollmentService->enrollStudentToACourse()
  ↓
addStudentToCourseSchedule()
  ↓
Student added as participant (role='student', status='invited')
```

### 3. Student Drops/Withdraws
```
CourseStudentController::updateEnrollmentStatus()
  ↓
enrollmentService->updateEnrollmentStatus()
  ↓
if status in ['dropped', 'withdrawn']:
    removeStudentFromCourseSchedule()
  ↓
ScheduleParticipant record deleted
```

### 4. Student Views Schedule
```
/api/users/{userId}/schedules/upcoming
  ↓
Schedule::forUser($userId)->upcoming()
  ↓
whereHas('participants', user_id = $userId)
  ↓
Returns all schedules where user is a participant
```

## Key Methods

### CourseController.php

**addStudentToCourseSchedule()**
- Called: After successful enrollment
- Purpose: Add individual student to existing course schedules
- Parameters: `$courseId`, `$studentId`
- Creates: ScheduleParticipant record with role='student'

**removeStudentFromCourseSchedule()** (in CourseController)
- Created but not currently used
- Purpose: For future drop functionality from CourseController

### CourseStudentController.php

**updateEnrollmentStatus()**
- Called: When student status changes
- Triggers: `removeStudentFromCourseSchedule()` for 'dropped'/'withdrawn'
- Effect: Removes student from schedule participants

**removeStudentFromCourseSchedule()**
- Called: When status = 'dropped' or 'withdrawn'
- Purpose: Remove student from all course schedules
- Parameters: `$courseId`, `$studentId`
- Deletes: ScheduleParticipant records for student

## Important Notes

1. **Namespace Consistency**: Always use `'App\\Models\\Course'` string for schedulable_type queries, not `Course::class`

2. **Duplicate Prevention**: The `addStudentToCourseSchedule()` method checks for existing participants before adding

3. **Silent Failures**: Both add and remove methods catch exceptions to avoid breaking enrollment/unenrollment

4. **Logging**: All operations are logged for debugging:
   - Student added: INFO level with counts
   - Student removed: INFO level with counts
   - Failures: ERROR level with exception details

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Student enrollment creates schedule participant
- [x] Student sees schedule in upcoming schedules
- [x] Duplicate enrollment doesn't create duplicate participants
- [x] Student removal (drop/withdraw) removes schedule participant
- [x] Student no longer sees schedule after drop
- [x] Instructor always appears as participant (role='instructor')
- [x] Multiple schedules per course handled correctly
