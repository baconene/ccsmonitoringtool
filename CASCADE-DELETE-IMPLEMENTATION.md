# Cascading Delete Implementation Summary

## Overview
All models have been refactored to ensure proper cascading delete behavior using Eloquent's `boot()` method with `deleting` event handlers.

## Models with Cascading Deletes

### 1. **Course Model**
When a course is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Modules (via `modules()` relationship)
- ✅ Lessons (via `lessons()` relationship)
- ✅ Course enrollments (via `enrollments()` relationship)
- ✅ Many-to-many detach: Grade levels, Users

### 2. **Module Model**
When a module is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Lessons (via `lessons()` relationship)
- ✅ Module completions (via `moduleCompletions()` relationship)
- ✅ Many-to-many detach: Activities, Documents

### 3. **Lesson Model**
When a lesson is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Lesson completions (via `lessonCompletions()` relationship)
- ✅ Many-to-many detach: Documents, Modules

### 4. **Activity Model**
When an activity is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Quiz (via `quiz()` relationship)
- ✅ Assignment (via `assignment()` relationship)
- ✅ Student activities (via `studentActivities()` relationship)
- ✅ Student quiz progress (via direct delete)
- ✅ Many-to-many detach: Modules

### 5. **Quiz Model**
When a quiz is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Questions (via `questions()` relationship)
- ✅ Student quiz progress (via `studentQuizProgress()` relationship)

### 6. **Question Model**
When a question is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Question options (via `options()` relationship)
- ✅ Student quiz answers (via `studentQuizAnswers()` relationship)

### 7. **Student Model**
When a student is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Course enrollments (via `courseEnrollments()` relationship)
- ✅ Student activities (via `studentActivities()` relationship)
- ✅ Quiz progress (via `quizProgress()` relationship)
- ✅ Lesson completions (via `lessonCompletions()` relationship)
- ✅ Module completions (via `moduleCompletions()` relationship)

### 8. **StudentActivity Model**
When a student activity is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Assignment progress (via `assignmentProgress()` relationship)
- ✅ Project progress (via `projectProgress()` relationship)
- ✅ Assessment progress (via `assessmentProgress()` relationship)

### 9. **StudentQuizProgress Model**
When student quiz progress is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Student quiz answers (via `answers()` relationship)

### 10. **User Model**
When a user is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Student profile (via `student()` relationship)
- ✅ Instructor profile (via `instructor()` relationship)
- ✅ Many-to-many detach: Courses

### 11. **GradeLevel Model**
When a grade level is deleted, it cascades to:
- ✅ Many-to-many detach: Courses

## Cascade Chain Example

### Deleting a Course:
```
Course (deleted)
└── Modules
    ├── Lessons
    │   └── Lesson Completions
    └── Module Completions
└── Activities
    ├── Quizzes
    │   ├── Questions
    │   │   ├── Question Options
    │   │   └── Student Quiz Answers
    │   └── Student Quiz Progress
    └── Assignments
└── Course Enrollments
└── Detach: Grade Levels, Users
```

### Deleting a Student:
```
Student (deleted)
├── Course Enrollments
├── Student Activities
│   ├── Assignment Progress
│   ├── Project Progress
│   └── Assessment Progress
├── Quiz Progress
│   └── Quiz Answers
├── Lesson Completions
└── Module Completions
```

## Database Foreign Key Constraints

### Already Set in Migrations:
Most relationships already have `onDelete('cascade')` or `onDelete('set null')` in migrations:

**CASCADE:**
- courses → instructor_id, created_by
- modules → course_id, created_by
- lessons → course_id, module_id
- activities → created_by, activity_type_id
- quizzes → activity_id, created_by
- questions → quiz_id
- question_options → question_id
- assignments → activity_id, created_by
- student_activities → student_id, activity_id, course_id, module_id
- student_quiz_progress → student_id, quiz_id, activity_id
- student_quiz_answers → student_id, quiz_progress_id, question_id
- course_enrollments → user_id, course_id, student_id
- module_completions → user_id, student_id, module_id, course_id
- lesson_completions → user_id, student_id, lesson_id, course_id

**SET NULL:**
- courses → grade_level_id
- lessons → module_id
- assignments → document_id
- modules → created_by

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: No orphaned records in the database
2. **Consistency**: All related data is properly cleaned up
3. **Performance**: Single delete operation handles all cascades
4. **Maintainability**: Clear cascade logic in model boot methods
5. **Safety**: Both application-level (Eloquent) and database-level (foreign keys) cascades

## Testing Recommendations

Test the following deletion scenarios:
1. ✅ Delete a course with modules, lessons, and enrollments
2. ✅ Delete a student with progress records
3. ✅ Delete an activity with quiz and student progress
4. ✅ Delete a module with lessons and activities
5. ✅ Delete a user with student/instructor profile
6. ✅ Verify no orphaned records remain after deletions

## Notes

- **Double Protection**: Most relationships have both Eloquent cascades (in models) AND database-level cascades (in migrations)
- **Many-to-Many**: Pivot table records are detached using `detach()` method
- **Soft Deletes**: Not implemented - all deletes are permanent
- **Performance**: For large datasets, consider batch deletion or background jobs
- **Logging**: Database logs capture all cascade operations via foreign key constraints
