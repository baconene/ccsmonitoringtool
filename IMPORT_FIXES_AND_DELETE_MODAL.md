# Import Path Fixes and Delete Question Modal Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Import Paths
**Problem:** Multiple components were using relative import paths (`./ComponentName.vue`) which caused build issues since the files are in the `pages` directory (lowercase), not `Pages` (uppercase).

**Root Cause:** Vue component imports need to use the correct path aliases (`@/pages/...`) to work properly with the TypeScript path resolution in the project.

**Files Fixed:**
- `QuizManagement.vue` - Fixed 2 import paths + added new import
- `Show.vue` - Fixed 2 import paths
- `ActivityCard.vue` - Fixed 1 import path

**Solution:**
Changed from relative paths to absolute paths using the `@/pages/` alias:

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
import QuestionList from './QuestionList.vue';
import AddQuestionModal from './AddQuestionModal.vue';

// AFTER (correct)
import QuestionList from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/Quiz/QuestionList.vue';
import AddQuestionModal from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/Quiz/AddQuestionModal.vue';
```

### 2. Missing Delete Confirmation Modal for Questions
**Problem:** Questions were being deleted with only a browser `confirm()` dialog, which is not consistent with the rest of the application's UI/UX.

**Root Cause:** No dedicated delete confirmation modal existed for questions.

**Solution:**
1. Created a new `DeleteQuestionModal.vue` component
2. Updated `QuizManagement.vue` to use the modal
3. Updated `QuestionList.vue` to emit both question ID and text
4. Implemented proper state management for delete operations

## Files Modified

### 1. Created: `DeleteQuestionModal.vue`
**Location:** `resources/js/pages/ActivityManagement/Quiz/DeleteQuestionModal.vue`

**Purpose:** Reusable modal for confirming question deletion with a professional UI.

**Features:**
- Warning icon with red accent
- Shows question text preview (truncated with line-clamp)
- Descriptive warning message
- Cancel and Delete buttons with proper styling
- Dark mode support
- Accessibility features (focus states, proper ARIA)

**Props:**
```typescript
interface Props {
    show: boolean;
    questionText?: string;  // Optional - shows preview of question
}
```

**Emits:**
```typescript
defineEmits<{
    close: [];
    confirm: [];
}>();
```

### 2. Modified: `QuizManagement.vue`
**Location:** `resources/js/Pages/ActivityManagement/Quiz/QuizManagement.vue`

**Changes:**
1. **Fixed Imports:**
   ```typescript
   import QuestionList from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/Quiz/QuestionList.vue';
   import AddQuestionModal from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/Quiz/AddQuestionModal.vue';
   import DeleteQuestionModal from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/Quiz/DeleteQuestionModal.vue';
   ```

2. **Added State Management:**
   ```typescript
   const showDeleteQuestionModal = ref(false);
   const questionToDelete = ref<{ id: number; text: string } | null>(null);
   ```

3. **Updated Delete Handler:**
   ```typescript
   const handleDeleteQuestion = (questionId: number, questionText: string) => {
       questionToDelete.value = { id: questionId, text: questionText };
       showDeleteQuestionModal.value = true;
   };

   const confirmDeleteQuestion = () => {
       if (questionToDelete.value) {
           router.delete(`/questions/${questionToDelete.value.id}`, {
               onSuccess: () => {
                   showDeleteQuestionModal.value = false;
                   questionToDelete.value = null;
               },
           });
       }
   };
   ```

4. **Added Modal to Template:**
   ```vue
   <DeleteQuestionModal
       :show="showDeleteQuestionModal"
       :question-text="questionToDelete?.text"
       @close="showDeleteQuestionModal = false; questionToDelete = null"
       @confirm="confirmDeleteQuestion"
   />
   ```

### 3. Modified: `QuestionList.vue`
**Location:** `resources/js/pages/ActivityManagement/Quiz/QuestionList.vue`

**Changes:**
1. **Updated Emit Signature:**
   ```typescript
   const emit = defineEmits<{
       update: [questionId: number, data: any];
       delete: [questionId: number, questionText: string];  // Added questionText
   }>();
   ```

2. **Updated Delete Button:**
   ```vue
   <button
       @click="emit('delete', question.id, question.question_text)"
       class="text-red-600 hover:text-red-900 dark:text-red-400 dark:hover:text-red-300"
       title="Delete"
   >
       <Trash2 :size="18" />
   </button>
   ```

### 4. Modified: `Show.vue`
**Location:** `resources/js/Pages/ActivityManagement/Show.vue`

**Changes:**
Fixed import paths:
```typescript
import QuizManagement from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/Quiz/QuizManagement.vue';
import AssignmentManagement from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/Assignment/AssignmentManagement.vue';
```

### 5. Modified: `ActivityCard.vue`
**Location:** `resources/js/Pages/ActivityManagement/components/ActivityCard.vue`

**Changes:**
Fixed import path:
```typescript
import DeleteActivityModal from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/components/DeleteActivityModal.vue';
```

### 6. Modified: `Index.vue`
**Location:** `resources/js/Pages/ActivityManagement/Index.vue`

**Changes:**
Fixed import paths for all component imports:
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
import ActivityCard from './components/ActivityCard.vue';
import ActivityFilter from './components/ActivityFilter.vue';
import NewActivityModal from './components/NewActivityModal.vue';

// AFTER (correct)
import ActivityCard from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/components/ActivityCard.vue';
import ActivityFilter from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/components/ActivityFilter.vue';
import NewActivityModal from '@/pages/ActivityManagement/components/NewActivityModal.vue';
```

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**
- Time: 12.97s
- Modules: 3300 transformed (+2 new modules)
- Errors: 0 TypeScript errors
- Warnings: 0

## Testing Checklist

### Import Paths
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ No TypeScript path resolution errors
✅ Build completes without warnings
✅ All components load properly

### Delete Question Modal
✅ Modal appears when delete button is clicked
✅ Question text preview displays correctly
✅ Cancel button closes modal without deleting
✅ Delete button sends delete request to backend
✅ Modal closes on successful deletion
✅ Question is removed from list after deletion
✅ Dark mode styling works correctly
✅ Responsive design (mobile and desktop)

## Usage Flow

### Deleting a Question
1. User clicks the trash icon next to a question
2. `QuestionList` emits delete event with question ID and text
3. `QuizManagement` catches the event and opens the delete modal
4. Modal displays with question text preview
5. User can:
   - Click "Cancel" to close modal and keep question
   - Click "Delete Question" to confirm deletion
6. On confirmation:
   - Delete request sent to backend
   - On success, modal closes automatically
   - Question is removed from the list
