# Course Visibility Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
❌ Only 1 course showing in Course Management  
❌ Database has 5 courses total

## Root Cause
Backend filter was too restrictive:
```php
->where('created_by', auth()->id()); // Only created courses
```

## Solution
Updated to show:
1. ✅ Courses user created (`created_by`)
2. ✅ Courses user is assigned to teach (`instructor_id`)
3. ✅ All courses for admins

## Results After Fix

### Example: User ID 4 (Instructor ID 1)

**Before Fix**:
- Only saw 1 course (Course 1, created_by=4)

**After Fix**:
- Course 1 (created_by=4) ✅ **Created by user**
- Course 5 (instructor_id=1) ✅ **Assigned to teach**
- **Total: 2 courses visible**

### Admin Users
**See all 5 courses** - no filter applied

## Database Verification

```
Total Courses: 5

id | title                  | instructor_id | created_by
---|------------------------|---------------|------------
1  | Advanced Mathematics   | 1             | 4
2  | Physics Fundamentals   | 2             | 5
3  | Computer Programming   | 3             | 6
4  | TEST                   | 4             | 7
5  | TEST AD                | 1             | 1
```

## Code Change

**File**: `app/Services/CourseService.php`

```php
// OLD: Only created courses
->where('created_by', auth()->id());

// NEW: Created OR assigned courses
if ($user && !$user->isAdmin()) {
    $instructorId = $user->instructor ? $user->instructor->id : null;
    
    $query->where(function($q) use ($user, $instructorId) {
        $q->where('created_by', $user->id);
        if ($instructorId) {
            $q->orWhere('instructor_id', $instructorId);
        }
    });
}
```

## Frontend Check
✅ **No issues found** - Frontend shows all courses from backend  
✅ Only filters based on search text  
✅ No hidden restrictions

## Testing

Refresh the page and you should now see:
- If **Instructor**: Courses you created + courses assigned to you
- If **Admin**: All courses in the system
