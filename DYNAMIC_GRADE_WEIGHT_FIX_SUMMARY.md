# Dynamic Grade Weight Fix - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Problem Statement

The grade calculation system had a critical bug where it used static weights regardless of which components existed in a module. This caused incorrect grade calculations when:
- A module had only lessons (no activities)
- A module had only activities (no lessons)
- A module had only certain activity types (e.g., only Quizzes, missing Assignments/Assessments/Exercises)

### Example of the Bug:
```
Module with 1 Lesson (90%) + 2 Quizzes (85% avg)
Configured weights: Lessons 20%, Activities 80%
Activity type weights: Quiz 30%, Assignment 15%, Assessment 35%, Exercise 20%

WRONG Calculation:
- Lesson: 90% √ó 20% = 18 points
- Activities: 85% √ó 80% = 68 points (but Quiz was only 30% of activities!)
- Module Score: 86% ‚ùå INCORRECT

CORRECT Calculation:
- Quiz weight should be normalized to 100% (since it's the only activity type)
- Lesson: 90% √ó 20% = 18 points
- Activities: 85% √ó 100% = 85 points (Quiz gets full weight)
- Activity contribution: 85 √ó 80% = 68 points
- Module Score: 86% ‚úÖ CORRECT (but with proper activity weight distribution)
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Service Updates

**File**: `app/Services/GradeCalculatorService.php`

#### Method: `calculateModuleGrade()`
**Changes:**
- Added existence checks: `$hasLessons` and `$hasActivities`
- Implemented dynamic weight adjustment based on what exists:
  - Both exist ‚Üí Use configured weights (e.g., 20%/80%)
  - Only lessons ‚Üí Lessons 100%, Activities 0%
  - Only activities ‚Üí Lessons 0%, Activities 100%
- Added new return fields: `has_lessons`, `has_activities`, `lesson_weight_used`, `activity_weight_used`

**Code Added:**
```php
// Check what exists in the module
$hasLessons = $module->lessons()->count() > 0;
$hasActivities = $module->activities()->count() > 0;

// Dynamically adjust weights based on what exists
if ($hasLessons && $hasActivities) {
    // Both exist: Use configured weights as-is
    $actualLessonWeight = $configuredLessonWeight;
    $actualActivityWeight = $configuredActivityWeight;
} elseif ($hasLessons && !$hasActivities) {
    // Only lessons: Lessons get 100%
    $actualLessonWeight = 100;
    $actualActivityWeight = 0;
} elseif (!$hasLessons && $hasActivities) {
    // Only activities: Activities get 100%
    $actualLessonWeight = 0;
    $actualActivityWeight = 100;
}
```

#### Method: `calculateModuleActivityScore()`
**Changes:**
- Added logic to collect configured weights for existing activity types only
- Implemented weight normalization to always total 100%
- Updated to return normalized weights for each activity type
- Added new return fields: `has_activities`, `types_present`, `normalized_weights`

**Code Added:**
```php
// Get configured weights for each activity type that exists
$configuredWeights = [];
$totalConfiguredWeight = 0;

foreach ($activitiesByType as $typeName => $typeActivities) {
    $weight = $this->getActivityTypeWeight($typeName, $module->course_id);
    $configuredWeights[$typeName] = $weight;
    $totalConfiguredWeight += $weight;
}

// Normalize weights to total 100% for existing types only
$normalizedWeights = [];
if ($totalConfiguredWeight > 0) {
    foreach ($configuredWeights as $typeName => $weight) {
        $normalizedWeights[$typeName] = ($weight / $totalConfiguredWeight) * 100;
    }
}

// Calculate weighted score using normalized weights
$weightedScore = 0;
foreach ($activitiesByType as $typeName => $typeActivities) {
    $typeScore = $this->calculateActivityTypeScore($userId, $typeActivities, $module->id);
    $normalizedWeight = $normalizedWeights[$typeName] ?? 0;
    $weightedScore += ($typeScore['average_score'] * ($normalizedWeight / 100));
}
```

### 2. Frontend Simulator Updates

**File**: `resources/js/Pages/Admin/GradeSettings.vue`

#### New Features Added:
1. **Component Existence Toggles**: Checkboxes to simulate which components exist
2. **Dynamic Weight Display**: Real-time normalized weight calculation
3. **Enhanced Breakdown**: Shows lesson contribution, activity score, and activity contribution
4. **Visual Feedback**: Disabled inputs for unchecked components

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
const simHasLessons = ref(true);
const simHasQuizzes = ref(true);
const simHasAssignments = ref(true);
const simHasAssessments = ref(true);
const simHasExercises = ref(true);
```

**Dynamic Weight Calculations:**
```typescript
// Normalize activity type weights based on what exists
const dynamicActivityWeights = computed(() => {
    const weights: Record<string, number> = {};
    let total = 0;

    if (simHasQuizzes.value) {
        weights.Quiz = Number(quizWeight.value);
        total += weights.Quiz;
    }
    // ... similar for other types

    // Normalize to 100%
    if (total > 0) {
        Object.keys(weights).forEach(key => {
            weights[key] = (weights[key] / total) * 100;
        });
    }

    return weights;
});

// Adjust module component weights
const dynamicModuleWeights = computed(() => {
    const hasActivities = simHasQuizzes.value || simHasAssignments.value || 
                         simHasAssessments.value || simHasExercises.value;

    if (simHasLessons.value && hasActivities) {
        return {
            lessons: Number(lessonWeight.value),
            activities: Number(activityWeight.value)
        };
    } else if (simHasLessons.value && !hasActivities) {
        return { lessons: 100, activities: 0 };
    } else if (!simHasLessons.value && hasActivities) {
        return { lessons: 0, activities: 100 };
    }
});
```

**UI Enhancements:**
- Checkboxes next to each component label
- Badge showing normalized weight percentage
- Disabled inputs for unchecked components (with opacity styling)
- Detailed breakdown showing:
  - Lesson contribution
  - Activity score
  - Activity contribution
  - Final module score

### 3. Testing Suite

**File**: `tests/Feature/DynamicGradeWeightTest.php`

Created comprehensive tests covering:

1. **Module with only lessons**
   - Verifies lessons get 100% weight, activities get 0%
   
2. **Module with only activities**
   - Verifies activities get 100% weight, lessons get 0%
   
3. **Module with only one activity type**
   - Verifies the single activity type gets 100% of activity weight
   - Tests weight normalization for missing types
   
4. **Module with multiple activity types**
   - Verifies weights are normalized proportionally
   - Tests that total always equals 100%

**Test Execution:**
```bash
php artisan test --filter DynamicGradeWeightTest
```

Comprehensive documentation including:
- Problem explanation with examples
- How the two-level weight adjustment works
