3. `STUDENT_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM.md` (documentation)

### Files Modified
1. `routes/web.php` - Added 7 lines (new route group)

## Migration from Assessment Management

If you had an `/assessment-management` route/page:
1. This new `/student-management` can replace it
2. Or they can coexist (different purposes)
3. Assessment = grading focus
4. Student Management = monitoring focus

## Success Metrics

The implementation is successful if:
- ‚úÖ Instructors can view all their students in one place
- ‚úÖ Search and filtering work smoothly
- ‚úÖ Export generates accurate CSV files
- ‚úÖ Page loads in < 2 seconds
- ‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Responsive on all devices
- ‚úÖ Accessible to screen readers (future improvement)

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm run build` to compile assets
- [ ] Test all routes work correctly
- [ ] Verify database queries are optimized
- [ ] Check file permissions for exports
- [ ] Test with large datasets (100+ students)
- [ ] Verify CSV download works on all browsers
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Review security permissions
- [ ] Update navigation menu to include link
- [ ] Train instructors on new feature
