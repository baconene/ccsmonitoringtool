# Student Profile Navigation Fix

## Date: October 17, 2025

## Issue
Getting 404 error when clicking the eye icon (👁️) to view student details:
```
GET http://192.168.1.18:8000/student/1/details 404 (Not Found)
```

## Root Cause
**ID Mismatch**: The frontend was passing the Student model ID, but the route expected the User ID.

- **Student Management** returns student data with `id` field (Student model ID)
- **Route `/student/{id}/details`** expects `{id}` to be User ID
- Result: Route tried to find User with ID = 1, but that's actually a Student ID

## Solution

### 1. Backend Fix (StudentManagementController.php)
Added `user_id` to the student data returned by `getStudentsByCourse()`:

```php
return [
    'id' => $student->id,              // Student model ID (for internal use)
    'user_id' => $student->user_id,    // User ID (for navigation) ← ADDED
    'student_id_text' => $student->student_id_text,
    // ... rest of fields
];
```

### 2. Frontend Fix (StudentManagement.vue)

#### A. Updated Student Interface
```typescript
interface Student {
  id: number;           // Student model ID
  user_id: number;      // User ID ← ADDED
  student_id_text: string;
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

#### B. Updated viewStudentProfile Function
```typescript
// Before
const viewStudentProfile = (studentId: number) => {
  router.visit(`/student/${studentId}/details`);
};

// After
const viewStudentProfile = (userId: number) => {
  // Navigate using user_id, not student.id
  router.visit(`/student/${userId}/details`);
};
```

#### C. Updated Button Click Handler
```vue
<!-- Before -->
<button @click="viewStudentProfile(student.id)">
  <Eye class="w-5 h-5" />
</button>

<!-- After -->
<button @click="viewStudentProfile(student.user_id)">
  <Eye class="w-5 h-5" />
</button>
```

## Data Flow

### Before (Broken)
```
Student Management
  ↓ student.id = 1 (Student model ID)
Route: /student/1/details
  ↓ Looks for User with ID = 1
  ↓ User ID 1 might be Admin, not the student!
404 Not Found ❌
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Student Management
  ↓ student.user_id = 9 (User ID of student)
Route: /student/9/details
  ↓ Looks for User with ID = 9
  ↓ Finds student user correctly
Student Profile Page ✅
```

## Example Data Structure

### Student Model (Database)
```
students table:
- id: 1 (Student model primary key)
- user_id: 9 (Foreign key to users table)
- student_id_text: "STU-2024-001"
- section: "A"
- grade_level_id: 3
```

### User Model (Database)
```
users table:
- id: 9 (User primary key) ← This is what route expects
- name: "Student User 1"
- email: "student1@example.com"
- role_id: 3 (student role)
```

### API Response (After Fix)
```json
{
  "students": [
    {
      "id": 1,              // Student model ID (internal)
      "user_id": 9,         // User ID (for navigation) ✓
      "student_id_text": "STU-2024-001",
      "name": "Student User 1",
      "email": "student1@example.com",
      "section": "A",
      // ... other fields
    }
  ]
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `app/Http/Controllers/Instructor/StudentManagementController.php` - Added user_id to response
2. `resources/js/Pages/Instructor/StudentManagement.vue` - Updated interface and navigation

## Testing
- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] user_id field included in backend response
- [x] Frontend uses user_id for navigation
- [ ] Test clicking eye icon navigates to correct student profile

## Related Routes

All student profile routes use User ID, not Student ID:

```php
// Correct usage - expects User ID
Route::get('/student/{id}/details', function ($id) {
    $student = User::findOrFail($id);  // User ID
    // ...
});
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Always use `user_id` when navigating to user-related pages**
- Student profile routes expect User ID
- Student Management uses Student model ID internally
- Both IDs are needed for different purposes:
  - `student.id` - For student-specific queries (activities, enrollments)
  - `student.user_id` - For user-related navigation (profile, details)

## Next Steps
1. Clear browser cache
2. Refresh page
3. Login as instructor
4. Navigate to Student Management
5. Select a course
6. Click eye icon (👁️) on any student
7. Verify it navigates to student profile successfully
