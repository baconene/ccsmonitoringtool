October 13, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Bulk Upload Modal Not Displaying Properly**
**Problem:** The bulk upload modal was being rendered inside the collapsible section instead of appearing as a proper modal overlay.

**Solution:**
- Wrapped the modal in `<Teleport to="body">` to render it at the document body level
- Added proper z-index (`z-[9999]`) to ensure it appears above all other content
- Added backdrop blur effect for better visual separation
- Implemented smooth transitions for both backdrop and modal content
- Modal now properly overlays the entire page instead of being confined to the collapse container

**Changes Made:**
- File: `resources/js/pages/ActivityManagement/Quiz/BulkUploadModal.vue`
- Added Teleport wrapper to move modal to body
- Increased z-index to 9999
- Added backdrop-blur-sm for better visual effect
- Added scale transition animations for smooth appearance

### 2. **Simplified and Repositioned Action Buttons**

#### A. Activity Show Page (Show.vue)
**Problem:** Edit and Delete buttons were too prominent with gradient backgrounds and took up too much space.

**Solution:**
- Changed from gradient colorful buttons to simple outlined buttons
- Reduced button size and padding
- Made button text responsive (hidden on small screens, visible on larger screens)
- Aligned buttons to the top-right beside activity info
- Added icon-only view on mobile for space efficiency

**Before:**
```vue
<button class="flex-1 sm:flex-none ... bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-500 to-orange-500 ...">
    <Edit :size="16" />
    <span>Edit</span>
</button>
```

**After:**
```vue
<button class="flex items-center gap-1.5 px-3 py-2 text-sm bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 
    text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 ...">
    <Edit :size="16" />
    <span class="hidden sm:inline">Edit</span>
</button>
```

#### B. Quiz Management Section (QuizManagement.vue)
**Problem:** Action buttons were too large and cluttered the interface.

**Solution:**
- Simplified all action buttons (Add Question, Bulk Upload, CSV Template)
- Reduced button sizes from full-size to compact
- Made button text responsive (hidden on mobile, shown on desktop)
- Changed color scheme to be less prominent
- CSV Template button changed to outlined style
- Kept Upload and Add buttons with solid backgrounds for primary actions

**Button Changes:**
1. **CSV Template Button**
   - Changed from solid green to outlined green
   - Added tooltip title attribute
   - Text hidden on mobile: "Template"

2. **Bulk Upload Button**
   - Reduced padding and size
   - Changed from large to compact style
   - Text hidden on mobile: "Upload"

3. **Add Question Button**
   - Reduced padding and size
   - Changed from large to compact style
   - Text hidden on mobile: "Add"

4. **Create Quiz Section**
   - Reorganized buttons in a cleaner flex layout
   - Responsive stacking on mobile devices
   - CSV Template button moved to tertiary position
   - Simplified button labels
