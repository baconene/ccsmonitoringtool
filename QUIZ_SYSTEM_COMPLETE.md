---

## Routes Added ✅

**File**: `routes/web.php`

```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:student'])->prefix('student')->name('student.')->group(function () {
    // Existing course routes...
    
    // Quiz routes
    Route::get('/quiz/start/{activity}', [StudentQuizController::class, 'start'])->name('quiz.start');
    Route::post('/quiz/{progress}/answer', [StudentQuizController::class, 'submitAnswer'])->name('quiz.answer');
    Route::post('/quiz/{progress}/submit', [StudentQuizController::class, 'submit'])->name('quiz.submit');
    Route::get('/quiz/{progress}/results', [StudentQuizController::class, 'results'])->name('quiz.results');
    Route::get('/quiz/{activity}/progress', [StudentQuizController::class, 'getProgress'])->name('quiz.progress');
});
```

---

## UI Components Created

### Textarea Component ✅
**Location**: `resources/js/components/ui/textarea/`

Created the missing Textarea component for enumeration and short-answer questions:
- `Textarea.vue` - Main component with v-model support
- `index.ts` - Export file

---

## Build Status ✅

**Build**: Successful (11.86s)
**Modules**: 3,306 transformed
**Errors**: 0
**New Assets Created**:
- `QuizTaking-BvkbF-Wr.css` - Quiz taking styles
- `QuizResults-Bu_kCjSh.css` - Results page styles
- `QuizTaking-CnwIWxew.js` - Quiz taking logic
- `QuizResults-B7hmQnRU.js` - Results page logic
- `CourseDetail-Djh5ZXv5.js` - Course detail page

---

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Removed Component Dependencies
Due to missing UI components, we simplified implementations:
- **Progress Bar**: Used native HTML div with Tailwind CSS instead of `@/components/ui/progress`
- **Radio Buttons**: Used native HTML radio inputs instead of `@/components/ui/radio-group`
- **Textarea**: Created simple Textarea component from scratch

### 2. Routing Approach
Used direct URL strings instead of route helpers:
```typescript
// Instead of: route('student.quiz.start', activity.id)
// We use: `/student/quiz/start/${activity.id}`
```
This avoids TypeScript errors with global route function while maintaining functionality.

### 3. TypeScript Type Safety
All components use proper TypeScript interfaces with types from `@/types/index.ts`.

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Run Migrations
```powershell
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Seed Sample Data
```powershell
php artisan db:seed --class=StudentQuizProgressSeeder
```

### 3. Test Flow as Student
1. Log in as a student user
2. Navigate to **My Courses** (`/student/courses`)
3. Click on a course
4. Look for quiz activities in modules
5. Click **"Start Quiz"**
6. Answer questions and navigate between them
7. Click **"Submit Quiz"**
8. View results with score and answer review

---

## Known Issues & Todo

### ⚠️ CourseDetail.vue Template
The template section still uses the old structure. Need to:
1. Remove loading/error states (data comes from props)
2. Remove old lesson-based structure
3. Add new module-based accordion
4. Add activity cards with quiz buttons
5. Display quiz progress and scores

### Workaround
For now, students can access quizzes directly via URL:
- Start Quiz: `/student/quiz/start/{activityId}`
- View Results: `/student/quiz/{progressId}/results`

## Conclusion

The student quiz system is **functionally complete** with all core components created and successfully built. Students can now take quizzes, submit answers, and view their results. The only remaining task is updating the CourseDetail.vue template to provide a better UX for accessing quizzes from the course page.

All backend code (migrations, models, controllers, seeders) was completed in previous sessions, and this session focused on creating the frontend Vue components to complete the user experience.

**Great work! The quiz system is ready for testing.** 🎉
