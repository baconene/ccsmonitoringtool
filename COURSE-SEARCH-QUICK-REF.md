    OR created_by LIKE '%Smith%'
    OR (instructor → user → name LIKE '%Smith%')
    OR (instructor → user → email LIKE '%Smith%')
    OR (creator → name LIKE '%Smith%')
    OR (creator → email LIKE '%Smith%')
        ↓

## Relationship Chain

```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Search by instructor_id returns correct courses
- [ ] Search by created_by returns correct courses
- [ ] Search by instructor name works
- [ ] Search by instructor email works
- [ ] Search by creator name works
- [ ] Search by creator email works
- [ ] Combined search works (multiple matches)
- [ ] Empty search shows all courses
- [ ] No errors in browser console
- [ ] Database queries are efficient

## Performance

### Eager Loading (Prevents N+1)
```php
Course::with(['creator', 'instructor.user', ...])
```

### Single Query Instead of Multiple
```
Without eager loading: 1 + N queries
With eager loading: 2-3 queries total
```

### Indexed Fields (Recommended)
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_courses_instructor ON courses(instructor_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_courses_creator ON courses(created_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_name ON users(name);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```
