# Course Schedule Modal & Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Modal Not Closing After Creation
**Problem:** The modal remained open after successfully creating a schedule, with no visual confirmation.

**Root Cause:** 
- Controller was using `redirect()->back()` without proper Inertia handling
- Modal's `onSuccess` callback was not properly triggering
- No flash messages were being set

**Solution:**
- Updated `CourseScheduleController` to set flash messages with success/error states
- Modified modal's Inertia request to use `preserveScroll: false` and `preserveState: false`
- Added `router.reload()` to refresh course data after successful creation
- Modal now properly closes on success

### 2. No Confirmation Message
**Problem:** Users had no visual feedback after creating/updating a schedule.

**Solution:**
- Added flash message system in `CourseManagement.vue`
- Created animated toast notification that appears at top-right
- Shows success (green) or error (red) messages for 5 seconds
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds or can be manually closed
- Styled with proper dark mode support

### 3. Schedules Not Showing in Banner
**Problem:** Newly created schedules weren't appearing in the course banner.

**Root Cause:**
- Schedules weren't being reloaded after creation
- `schedules` ref wasn't watching for prop changes

**Solution:**
- Added proper prop watching in `CourseBanner.vue`
- Updates `schedules` ref when course prop changes
- Removed `window.location.reload()` (too aggressive)
- Uses Inertia's built-in state management for reactivity

## Files Modified

- Added `->with('scheduleCreated', true)` flag

## How It Works Now

### Creating a Schedule

1. **User clicks "Create Schedule" button**
   - Modal opens with form

2. **User fills form and clicks "Create Schedule"**
   - Button shows "Creating..." with spinner
   - Form is disabled during submission

3. **Backend processes request**
   - Creates Schedule and ScheduleCourse records
   - Adds participants (creator, students, instructor)
   - Commits transaction
   - Returns redirect with flash message

4. **Frontend receives response**
   - Modal closes immediately
   - Inertia reloads course data (only 'courses' prop)
   - Course banner receives updated schedules
   - Toast notification appears (green, top-right)
   - Message: "Course schedule created successfully!"

5. **Auto-dismissal**
   - Toast fades out after 5 seconds
   - User can manually close with X button

### Error Handling

If schedule creation fails:
1. Modal stays open
2. Error message shows in modal (red box)
3. Submission button re-enables
4. User can fix issues and retry

### Schedule Display

Schedules now properly appear in banner:
- Shows up to 3 upcoming schedules
- Each schedule shows:
  - Title (or course name)
  - Date and time
  - Location (if provided)
  - Frequency badge (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
  - Session number (if provided)
- Sorted by date (earliest first)
- Updates immediately after creation

## Testing

### Test Schedule Creation

1. Navigate to Course Management
2. Click calendar plus icon on any course
3. Fill in required fields (start/end datetime)
4. Click "Create Schedule"
5. **Expected:**
   - Modal closes immediately
   - Green toast appears: "Course schedule created successfully!"
   - Schedule appears in course banner
   - Toast auto-dismisses after 5 seconds

### Test Error Handling

1. Open schedule modal
2. Enter end time before start time
3. Click "Create Schedule"
4. **Expected:**
   - Modal stays open
   - Red error message shows in modal
   - Can fix and retry

### Test Schedule Display

1. Create multiple schedules for a course
2. **Expected:**
   - All upcoming schedules show in banner
   - Sorted by date (earliest first)
   - Shows max 3 schedules
   - If more than 3, shows "+X more schedule(s)"

## Flash Message System

### Structure

```vue
<Transition>
  <div v-if="showFlashMessage" class="fixed top-4 right-4 z-50">
    <div class="flex items-center gap-3 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
      <CheckCircle /> <!-- or XCircle for errors -->
      <p>{{ flashMessage }}</p>
      <button @click="close">X</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</Transition>
```

### States

- **Success (Green):**
  - Icon: CheckCircle
  - Background: green-50/green-900
  - Border: green-200/green-800
  - Text: green-800/green-200

- **Error (Red):**
  - Icon: XCircle
  - Background: red-50/red-900
  - Border: red-200/red-800
  - Text: red-800/red-200

### Auto-Dismiss

```typescript
watch(
  () => page.props.flash,
  (flash: any) => {
    if (flash?.success) {
      showFlashMessage.value = true;
      setTimeout(() => {
        showFlashMessage.value = false;
      }, 5000); // 5 seconds
    }
  }
);
```

## Inertia Flow

### Before (Broken)

```
1. Submit form
2. Backend: redirect()->back()
3. Frontend: preserveScroll=true, preserveState=true
4. Result: Modal stays open, no refresh, no message
```

### After (Fixed)

```
1. Submit form
2. Backend: redirect()->back()->with('success', 'message')
3. Frontend: preserveScroll=false, preserveState=false
4. Frontend: onSuccess â†’ close modal + router.reload()
5. Watcher detects flash message
6. Toast appears
7. Schedules refresh in banner
```
