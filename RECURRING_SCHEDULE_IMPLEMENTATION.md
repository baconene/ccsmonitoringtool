# Recurring Schedule Implementation

## Overview
Implemented proper recurring schedule event generation for the calendar view. Instead of showing one long continuous event, recurring schedules now display individual event instances based on their recurrence pattern.

## Problem
Previously, a recurring schedule spanning multiple days (e.g., Thursday to Friday) would display as a single continuous block on the calendar. This was confusing for users who expected to see separate events for each occurrence.

**Example:**
- Schedule: "Weekly Class - Thursday & Friday" 
- Date Range: Jan 23 (Thu) to Jan 31 (Fri)
- Recurrence: FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TH,FR
- **Before**: One long event from Jan 23 to Jan 31
- **After**: Four separate events - Thu 23, Fri 24, Thu 30, Fri 31

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Updated Schedule TypeScript Interface
**File**: `resources/js/Pages/SchedulingManagement/UserSchedule.vue`

Added recurring schedule fields:
```typescript
interface Schedule {
  // ... existing fields
  is_recurring: boolean;
  recurrence_rule: string | null;
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced `calendarEvents` Computed Property
**Lines**: 135-182

Now checks if schedule is recurring and generates multiple events:
```typescript
if (schedule.is_recurring && schedule.recurrence_rule) {
  // Generate multiple events based on recurrence rule
  const recurringEvents = generateRecurringEvents(schedule, startDate, endDate, eventClass);
  allEvents.push(...recurringEvents);
} else {
  // Single event for non-recurring schedules
  allEvents.push(singleEvent);
}
```

#### 3. Implemented `generateRecurringEvents` Function
**Lines**: 184-245

**Key Features:**
- **Time Extraction**: Extracts hours and minutes from `from_datetime` (e.g., 11:00 AM)
- **Duration Calculation**: Calculates event duration in milliseconds
- **Date Range**: Iterates through all dates from `from_datetime` to `to_datetime`
- **FREQ Parsing**: Supports DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY frequencies
- **BYDAY Parsing**: For WEEKLY recurrence, parses day codes (SU, MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA)
- **Event Generation**: Creates separate event for each occurrence with extracted time applied

**BYDAY Parsing Example:**
```typescript
// Input: "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TH,FR"
// Output: byDays = [4, 5] (Thursday=4, Friday=5)
const dayMap = {
  'SU': 0, 'MO': 1, 'TU': 2, 'WE': 3, 
  'TH': 4, 'FR': 5, 'SA': 6
};
```

**Event Creation Logic:**
```typescript
// For each day in the date range
while (currentDate <= endDateOnly) {
  // Check if this day matches BYDAY pattern
  if (frequency === 'WEEKLY' && byDays.length > 0) {
    shouldCreateEvent = byDays.includes(currentDate.getDay());
  }
  
  if (shouldCreateEvent) {
    // Apply extracted time to this date
    eventStart.setHours(startTime.hours, startTime.minutes, 0, 0);
    eventEnd = new Date(eventStart.getTime() + duration);
    
    // Create event
    events.push({ start: eventStart, end: eventEnd, ... });
  }
  
  currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1); // Next day
}
```

### Backend Changes

#### Updated Schedule Data Response
**File**: `routes/web.php` (Lines 86-147)

Added recurring fields to schedule data:
```php
return [
    // ... existing fields
    'is_recurring' => $schedule->is_recurring,
    'recurrence_rule' => $schedule->recurrence_rule,
];
```

## Supported Recurrence Patterns

### 1. DAILY Recurrence
```
FREQ=DAILY
```
- Creates event for every day in date range
- **Example**: Jan 20 to Jan 24 → 5 daily events

### 2. WEEKLY Recurrence (Simple)
```
FREQ=WEEKLY
```
- Creates event every 7 days starting from first date
- **Example**: Start Jan 20 (Mon), End Jan 31 → Events on Jan 20, Jan 27

### 3. WEEKLY Recurrence with BYDAY
```
FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TH,FR
FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR
```
- Creates events only on specified days
- **Example**: BYDAY=TH,FR from Jan 23 to Jan 31 → Events on Thu 23, Fri 24, Thu 30, Fri 31

### 4. MONTHLY Recurrence
```
FREQ=MONTHLY
```
- Creates event on same day of each month
- **Example**: Start Jan 15, End Mar 15 → Events on Jan 15, Feb 15, Mar 15

## Test Cases

### Test Schedule #4: Daily Recurrence
```sql
UPDATE schedules SET 
  from_datetime = '2025-01-20 10:00:00',
  to_datetime = '2025-01-24 11:00:00',
  is_recurring = 1,
  recurrence_rule = 'FREQ=DAILY'
WHERE id = 4;
```

**Expected Result**: 5 events
- Mon Jan 20, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- Tue Jan 21, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- Wed Jan 22, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- Thu Jan 23, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- Fri Jan 24, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM

### Test Schedule #5: Weekly with BYDAY
```sql
UPDATE schedules SET 
  title = 'Weekly Class - Thursday & Friday',
  from_datetime = '2025-01-23 11:00:00',
  to_datetime = '2025-01-31 12:00:00',
  is_recurring = 1,
  recurrence_rule = 'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TH,FR'
WHERE id = 5;
```

**Expected Result**: 4 events
- Thu Jan 23, 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Fri Jan 24, 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Thu Jan 30, 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Fri Jan 31, 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Recurring schedule from Thu Oct 30 11:00 AM to Fri Oct 31 11:00 AM
- Calendar showed: ONE continuous block spanning 24 hours
- Confusion: "Why does my class show as a 24-hour event?"

### After
- Same schedule data
- Calendar shows: TWO separate events
  - Thu Oct 30, 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
  - Fri Oct 31, 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Clear visualization: "My class meets on Thursday and Friday at 11 AM"

## Technical Benefits

1. **Time Consistency**: All occurrences use the same start/end time from original schedule
2. **Flexible Patterns**: Supports multiple recurrence frequencies and day-of-week filters
3. **Duration Preservation**: Automatically calculates and applies correct duration to each event
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interface definitions
5. **Performance**: Efficient iteration through date range with early filtering

## iCalendar Standard Compliance

The implementation follows the iCalendar RFC 5545 standard for recurrence rules:
- **FREQ**: Specifies frequency (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY)
- **BYDAY**: Specifies days of the week (SU, MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA)
- **INTERVAL**: (Future) Specifies interval between occurrences
- **COUNT**: (Future) Limits number of occurrences
- **UNTIL**: Uses to_datetime as natural end date

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **INTERVAL Support**: `FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2` (every 2 weeks)
2. **BYMONTHDAY**: `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=1,15` (1st and 15th of each month)
3. **Exception Dates**: `EXDATE` to skip specific occurrences (holidays)
4. **Timezone Support**: Proper timezone handling for recurring events
5. **RRule.js Integration**: Use battle-tested library for complex patterns

### Code Location
If integrating RRule.js:
```bash
npm install rrule
```

```typescript
import { RRule } from 'rrule';

// Parse recurrence rule
const rrule = RRule.fromString(schedule.recurrence_rule);

// Generate occurrences
const dates = rrule.between(startDateOnly, endDateOnly);

// Create events
dates.forEach(date => {
  const eventStart = new Date(date);
  eventStart.setHours(startTime.hours, startTime.minutes);
  // ... create event
});
```

## Files Modified

1. **routes/web.php**
   - Added `is_recurring` and `recurrence_rule` to schedule response
   - Lines: 132-133

2. **resources/js/Pages/SchedulingManagement/UserSchedule.vue**
   - Updated Schedule interface (Lines: 19-51)
   - Enhanced calendarEvents computed (Lines: 135-182)
   - Added generateRecurringEvents function (Lines: 184-245)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate to Schedule Page**: `/schedule`
2. **Check Console**: Should see logs like "Created X recurring events"
3. **Verify Calendar Display**: 
   - Recurring schedules show multiple event cards
   - Each event has same time but different date
   - Non-recurring schedules still work normally
4. **Test Edit Mode**: Editing recurring schedule should still work with modal

## Conclusion

The recurring schedule implementation transforms the calendar view from confusing continuous blocks into clear, individual event instances. This aligns with user expectations and provides a professional scheduling experience comparable to Google Calendar or Outlook.

The implementation is flexible, maintainable, and follows industry standards, making it easy to extend with more advanced recurrence patterns in the future.
